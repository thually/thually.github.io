            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
                I am passionate about programming, algorithms and computation in general.
                I aspire to be a software engineer and work in the development of new technologies.
                I recently finished the <a

                    DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate</a>,
                and am currently working on the <a

                    Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate</a>.
                My favorite flavor is chocolate, my favorite movie Swiss Army Man, my favorite band Arctic Monkeys and I
                love listening to Minecraft music.

                        I studied at presented the paper "Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers" by
                        Gentry, Craig. I also used an implementation of the scheme in Python to create a

                        fights' results. Also the cells of each prisoner are kept track of and the history of
                        cell changes is stored. </li>

                I've had the chance to work with Ale on some coding and algorithm stuff, and let me tell you, they're
                pretty sharp. Ale has this knack for picking up new concepts quickly, and they're always the one in the
                group asking cool questions and taking the lead when needed. They're not just tech-savvy; they're a fun
                team player too. If you're looking for someone who's not only good with code but also easy to work with,
                Ale's your person.
                <span>&#8221;</span>

            <div class="recommendation">
                <span>&#8220;</span>
                Working with Ale has been an absolute delight. As a fellow computer science enthusiast, I can vouch for
                Ale's deep knowledge and dedication to their craft. Ale goes the extra mile to ensure that every project
                they work on is executed flawlessly. Ale's attention to detail and commitment to excellence are
                qualities that make them a top choice for any project requiring their expertise. I wholeheartedly
                recommend Ale for any future projects where precision and expertise are paramount.

                <span>&#8220;</span>
                Ale's been a great co-pilot on a few coding adventures. They really know their stuff and put in the
                effort to make things spot-on. Ale's attention to detail is on point, and they're always ready to lend a
                hand. If you need someone who's both knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with, I'd team up with Ale
                again in a heartbeat.
